      "We booked our accommodation for our pre and post cruise through NCL. This hotel is on a massive huge scale, I have never seen anything like it. Plenty of things to do on site. Staff are amazingly friendly and helpful. On our pre cruise stay were arrived at 7:30am and with a strict checkin policy of 3pm I would suggest booking the day before your arrival, so you can check in straight away. You can use the hotels facilities, but the wait is very long for your room to be ready. I would also suggest signing up to be a Hilton member ( which is free) as you are then in a priority check in queue. We were in the Tapa Tower for this part of our stay and found it a bit noisy at times and the air conditioning was a bit loud. On our return stay we were in the Kalia Tower which is much nicer and quieter. We had a premium king room with partial ocean. Much better than the view we had from the Tapa Tower. The adults only pool is also on level 4.Like everything in Hawaii it’s expensive to eat out. We dined out at CJ deli, Fresco Italian, Goofy’s and more around the hotel which were all fantastic. I can’t speak enough about all the fantastic wait staff. \n",

      "We used our points for an ocean front room in the Rainbow tower. Best vacation idea in a very long time. We could sit on the lanai and see the sea turtles swimming around while people swam by them unaware. We did the same thing later snorkeling. It’s hard to see them unless they poke their heads up next to you. It was easy to rent umbrellas and chairs, floaties and more. The Hilton is a huge property with its own village. When our luggage took a side trip, we loved the easy access to ABC stores. You can get just about anything there. The ice cream shop on site is wonderful but often has long lines. Timing is everything. We ate at CJ’s for breakfast and dinner. It’s not a hotel restaurant but in the village. Delicious. You could stay on the property and never leave. You could but you should not:) It’s within walking distance of all the shops and restaurants. We even walked to the Ala Moana mall, but there is a bus stop right there at the hotel that will get you there quick. There is a car rental place across the street. As for the room, it was nice. We had two double beds so ordered a roll alway too so everyone wouldn’t be too crowded. Registration can be a wait so I’d recommend digital registration. \n",
      "Not a Cyberbully\n",
      "\n",
      "Rude, unprofessional staff, always get things wrong. Their entire system sucks. Not sure how they maintain their business thus far. Maybe we have to tolerate substandard services for the sake of the tropical island?\n",

      "Hilton Hawaiian is a perfect resort, either for staycations for the locals, or vacations for the visitors. The location is right on the water of Waikiki, and right next to a beautiful lagoon where swimming, snorkeling, paddle boats and paddling boarding are allowed to rent. They have many different shops available that have loads of beautiful gifts. Different days they have lots of activities such as a movie night in the yard. They have about a dozen pools, great for families with kids. The staff and hospitality is so wonderful, and the food is to die for. I would recommend this as a wonderful resort for you to vist, kick back, and relax. Also enjoy the fireworks on Friday nights.\n",
      "Not a Cyberbully\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel facilities are vast since it’s about 3500 rooms. The line to check in if your “not” a Hilton member can be a lengthy wait. However they make checkout really easy by using phone instructions or Hilton app no complaints, loved it. We stayed in the Diamond Head bldg and our accommodations on 13th floor were nice. Housekeeping personnel were excellent and pleasant and we had a fairly decent view to the ocean from our balcony. You really don’t have to leave the village because it’s really an inclusion city with dining, eating, entertainment, etc. but it is Hawaii so you do want to adventure. For us personally we would have preferred a little bit less crowded environment. Parking is expensive and we used the hotel’s garage, never had a problem finding a spot. We stayed 5 days before jumping over to Maui had a wonderful time visiting.\n",
